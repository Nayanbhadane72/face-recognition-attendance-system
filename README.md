##Overview
face-recognition-attendance-system is a Python-based system developed by Nayan Bhadane and Team for managing user authentication and attendance. It provides an interface for admins to manage users, track attendance, and handle student details efficiently.

##Features
The project operates by allowing users to log in securely using a username and password. Administrators have access to a dedicated panel where they can add, edit, and remove users as needed. The system enables efficient attendance management by recording and storing user attendance data in a structured database. Additionally, it maintains comprehensive student records, including personal and academic details. The automated tracking system ensures that attendance data is processed and stored efficiently, minimizing manual intervention and improving accuracy.
Easy setup and installation.
